# Slop Singapore

A Singapore city simulation built with [three.js](https://threejs.org/), WebGPURenderer, and TSL. Explore Singapore's Central Area — the CBD and Marina Bay, Chinatown, the Civic District, Bugis, Little India, Orchard — on foot, by car, by bicycle, or by helicopter, with its traffic keeping left.

Singapore's own touches: Marina Bay Sands (three towers on their leaning legs under the SkyPark, its pool and gardens, Spectra's beams at night) and the Singapore Flyer (turning once in 32 minutes, its rim lit at night), the Supertrees of Gardens by the Bay (with the OCBC Skyway and their light show at night) and the Esplanade's spiky shells, modelled low-poly where OpenStreetMap maps them; koels calling, cicadas at dusk and crickets at night; afternoon thunderstorms with rain, lightning and thunder that arrives at the speed of sound (the storm button or `R`, or open the page with `?storm`); and the rest of the island beyond the Central Area — the HDB estates, Jurong, Changi, Sentosa — streamed in tiles of buildings and main roads around you, built in a Web Worker, with traffic on its main roads and teleports that arrive on the nearest of them.

Go somewhere: Navigate (`G`) drives you, self-drives, takes a Crazy Taxi or teleports you to a place, or tap anywhere on the map (`M`, true north up) to go there any of those ways. Navigating plans a route over the same road graph the traffic drives, lane by lane, with turn-by-turn directions on the HUD and the route on the radar and map. Drive it yourself, or hand the taxi over: Self-driving keeps to its lane at up to 90 km/h or the speed of the traffic ahead, changes lanes past slow traffic (waiting for a gap), stops at red lights and waits for the car ahead; Crazy Taxi drives flat out, treats every light as green, swerves into whatever lane is free (oncoming included) and is on the clock, with near misses paid into the fare and the next fare called when you drop off. Both autopilots watch the traffic: they track every vehicle and person around them from where they are seen frame by frame (estimating speed, braking and turn rate, never reading them off the traffic), predict where each will be over the next few seconds, and check their own plan against that: easing off, braking, or swerving to another line if that is what keeps clear. Self-driving looks 4 s ahead, keeps a metre or more of room and prefers braking; Crazy Taxi looks 3 s ahead, keeps a hand's breadth, swerves before it brakes, squeezes past half in the next lane, and will use any part of the road. Touch the controls to take the wheel back. `T` puts you in the cab: the Crazy Taxi Cam rides in the driver's seat, looks into the turns, leans out of them, widens with speed and jolts when you hit something.

Slop Singapore grew out of mrdoob's [Slop New York](https://github.com/mrdoob/slop-newyork), and New York still runs here: open the page with `?city=nyc`.

## Run it

Serve the folder and open it in a browser with WebGPU (or WebGL 2):

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1    # then open http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

## Make it your own

Fork it, remix it, improve it, break it. Make games, animations, films, experiments, or something completely different. Use it as a starting point and take it wherever you want. Have fun!

## Cities

Singapore is built from OpenStreetMap; `?city=<id>` loads another city. To add one, describe it in `tools/city/cities/<city>.mjs` (its area, origin, driving side, neighbourhoods and places), then:

```sh
node tools/city/fetch.mjs <city>                                  # OpenStreetMap layers from Overpass
node --max-old-space-size=8192 tools/city/build.mjs <city>        # writes js/<city>-geodata.js
node tools/city/preview.mjs <city> preview.png                    # a map of the result, to check it
```

The rest of the island, as streamed tiles (`island` in the city's config): buildings and main roads only, no traffic or colliders yet:

```sh
node tools/city/fetch-island.mjs <city>                            # buildings & main roads cell by cell, coastline, water
node --max-old-space-size=8192 tools/city/tiles.mjs <city>        # writes tiles/<city>/: index.json, a file per tile, roads.json for the maps
```

New York (`?city=nyc`) has its own data build from NYC Open Data: `node --max-old-space-size=8192 tools/build-geodata.mjs`.
